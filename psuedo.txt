fetch titles from twitch api
parse each title into space-delimited tokens
each title has an array in a 2d structure
each title array contains its tokens
iterate through each token, create a vertex in a weighted directed graph
token i's vertex is given an edge to token i+1 with weight n
n being the number of times the edge is drawn.
if token i+1 DNE (token i is the last), store i into an array for generating title length

generation:
choose a title length
choose a starting token
choose the next token based on the edges that the token points to
iterate until length has been fulfilled
print
