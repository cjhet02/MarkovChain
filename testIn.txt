Due to the nature of the project, the pre-packaged tests are only useful to check the adjacency lists.
The actual generated output at the end will always be different.
The test#.txt files are different training data files that I've included after cleaning them with a small python script.
The dataClean.py script is included if you would like to try your own data.
It takes in a file called testIn.txt and outputs cleaned data to cleaned.txt.

test1.txt is designed to test sentences with only unique words.

test2.txt is meant to test a few sentences that have a few words in common.

test3.txt is a sizeable chunk of Vol. 1 of the complete words of Edgar Allan Poe, it is meant to test a large dataset.
Test 3 will take significantly longer than the other two

test4.txt is a cleaned version of this file, just for fun.
